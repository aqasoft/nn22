# nn22 Basic Neural Networks for Octave
The project consists of a few very simple .m files for a Basic
Neural Networks study under Octave (or Matlab).

The idea is to provide a context for beginners that will allow to
develop neural networks, while at the same time get to see and feel
the behavior of a basic neural networks' functioning.

The code is completely open to be modified and may suit several scenarios.

The code commenting is verbose, and variables and functions do respect
English formatting, so that code may be self explanatory.

Messages to the screen are localized, both in English and Spanish,
and it is really easy to add another language to the localization.

If any further explanation is needed, the forum/discussion page
may be of help :)

Comments and suggestions are very welcome.
